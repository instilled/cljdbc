# Cljdbc

This is work in progress.

An opinonated JDBC wrapper for clojure inspired by `clojure.java.jdbc` and
funcool's `clojure.jdbc`. It uses `PreparedStatement`s for most of the
queries and adds further capabilities for named parameters, inspired by `yesql`.

# TODO

* (TBD) Transactional (with savepoints) & execution hooks
* (TBD) Pluggable `javax.sql.DataSource` factories for Hikari, Tomcat JDBC, C3P0
* (TBD) DDL statements



# Features & WIP

* Using `java.sql.PreparedStatement` everywhere (prooven by other implementations
  building on jdbc, e.g. hibernate)
* Named & positional parameters
* Multi dialect support (unified autogenerated pks retrieval, currently supported dialects: oracle,
mysql, postgres?

# Quick Start


# Rationale

Compare to and build on:
* clojure.java.jdbc
* funcool java.jdbc
* hibernate

Missing features:
* simple & standardized API
* named params
* transaction hooks
* savepoints
* unified multi-dialect support (e.g. autogenerated pks)
